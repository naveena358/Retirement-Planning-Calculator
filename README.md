# Retirement-Planning-Calculator
you will create an executable the application described below. Your application have to be fully functional, but should allow you to demonstrate the basic features of its user interface, including screen elements with realistic data, layouts, and navigation. You can choose the tool and platform that you want to use to build your prototype.
American Savings Education Council provides a method, called Ballpark Estimate, for the user to determine the annual amount of money one needs to save in order to meet his/her financial objectives
on retirement. A worksheet is provided to help the user to use this method, which can be found in the attached document Ballparkwks.pdf. Additional information can be found on the council’s web page at
http://www.choosetosave.org/ballpark/. Although the method is quite easy to follow, one must perform it by hand. You are asked to develop an interactive program to help the user use this method. In this project, the above-mentioned worksheet can be considered as the requirements specification.
Roughly, your program will take input from the user, perform calculation, and display the result
according to the worksheet


1. Make it easy for the user to use the application. For example, the social security income can be calculated from the user's current annual income according to the
rules stated in the worksheet. Your application should ask the user for his/her annual income and do the calculation, rather than having the user do it oneself. Also allow the user to select a
value for a data field, instead of typing it, wherever appropriate. Do not ask the user to provide any value that can be calculated from other values. If there are different ways to determine the
value for a field such as the expected annual income in retirement, give the user the options to choose.

2. Also, provide a “What If” function to allow the user to try different scenarios in a rapid fashion. When it is selected, the “What If” function will activate a dialog with a small number of data
fields, that is, those that the user can adjust in order to see a different result. For example, after entering all the data and seeing the result, the user may want to change the amount of expected
retirement income in order to find an amount of savings that is more affordable. In addition, there are two buttons in the screen, OK and Cancel, which are used to close the screen. While OK brings back the new data to the original screen, Cancel leaves the
data in the original screen intact. Provide three basic functions, namely Calculate, Print, and Reset. Function Calculate performs
calculation according to the method and displays the result.

3. Hence, the user interface should provide adequate information for the user to understand how to proceed step by step. Also your application may provide additional
information so as to make it more convenient for the user to plan for retirement, for example, displaying both the annual amount and monthly amount that the user needs to save
